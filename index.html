                    <div>
                        <p>European sustainability regulations are becoming increasingly complex and far-reaching, posing significant compliance challenges for businesses. The EU's Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) will require nearly <strong>50,000 companies</strong> to report detailed environmental and social information, and the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) is introducing new carbon-cost obligations on imports with a definitive regime starting in 2026.</p>
                        <p><strong>Battery recycling companies</strong>, at the forefront of the green transition, face the dual burden of meeting these evolving reporting standards and carbon regulations. Many lack the in-house expertise or resources to navigate hundreds of pages of legislation and guidance, resulting in uncertainty and risk of non-compliance.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <p><strong>LiCycle AI</strong> is a chatbot solution designed to address this problem by providing on-demand, location-specific regulatory guidance. It leverages advanced AI and a curated knowledge base of CSRD and CBAM legislation to answer businesses' questions in real time.</p>
                        <p>Integrated into a website, LiCycle AI acts as a virtual compliance advisor: a user can ask, <em>"What does CSRD require for a mid-sized recycler in Germany?"</em> or <em>"Does CBAM apply if I ship recycled battery materials to the EU?"</em> and receive an instant, accurate answer citing the relevant regulation.</p>

                        <p>CSRD and CBAM span 20+ documents and over 600 pages of technical requirements, making interpretation difficult for businesses without specialized legal teams.</p>
